    <p>Hi, My name is Jamshed, and I am an international student from Pakistan <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Flag_of_Pakistan.svg" 
     alt="Pakistan Flag" style="width:20px; height:auto;">, doing Bachelors in Computer Science @ <a href="https://www.seeu.edu.mk"> SEE University.</a></p>

    <p>My current life chapter is: connecting the dots... where I am tying all the concepts that I learnt in my Computer Science degree (and in my life). I am getting a sense that I am a digital construction worker. [Well, at least that's how I understand it now. ;) ].</p>
    <p>In the meantime, I got this idea:
        <ul>
            <li>A mobile app</li>
            <li>where I can pin my curated places</li>
            <li>and lets me see my friend(s)' curated places</li>
        </ul>
        and now I am learning what it takes to make this app, so:
        <ul>
            <li>I am currently learning the concepts and tools from <a href="#" onclick="alert('Oops! How about YOU open YouTube and search CS50Web by yourself if you REALLY REALLY want to explore.'); return false;">CS50Web</a> (in progress) </li>
        </ul>
        and hopefully I will present it soon. In the meantime, here is the <strong><a href="">Google Form</a></strong> that you can fill out to let me know if you will use this app, (takes <5 minutes!!)
    </p>
